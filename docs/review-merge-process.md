# Mappings Review / Merge Process

This document details the review and merge process for Parchment mappings.

### Requirements to merge:

- If we have any automatic tests, they all must pass.
  - Example: A PR may not be merged if the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is not signed.
- A PR requires two approving reviews
  - One approving review is required to be from a Parchment team member.
- We ask that people don’t review things that they don’t actually have the capability to effectively review (knowledge wise).
- All external reviewers and suggestions are welcome.

On Resolving conflicting opinions:

- Any names involving substantial conflicts should be available for public input for some length of time (i.e. a discussion time) before merging. After such time, the PR may be merged if there is:
  1. A simple majority of Parchment team reviewers
  2. In the event of a tie, A simple majority of all reviewers
- Submissions should be substantial, although are not required to have any 'minimum contribution' to be considered
  - Prefer submitting one PR containing a number of smaller unrelated contributions, than many PRs containing very small contributions.
  - On the other hand, do not lump together otherwise unrelated PR contributions unless there is a reason to do so (i.e. the unrelated contributions are small and can be easilly extended)
- Contributions must require a github authentication, to link contributors back to individual contributions.
- Parchment Team / Reviewers can be free to merge and/or review at any time, based on time.
- PRs are merged and squashed, linked back to the author.
