	METHOD betweenClosed (IIIIII)Ljava/lang/Iterable;
		COMMENT Creates an Iterable that returns all positions in the box specified by the given corners. <strong>Coordinates must be in order</strong>" e.g. x1 <= x2.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT This method uses {@link BlockPos.MutableBlockPos MutableBlockPos} instead of regular BlockPos, which grants better performance. However, the resulting BlockPos instances can only be used inside the iteration loop (as otherwise the value will change), unless {@link #toImmutable()} is called. This method is ideal for searching large areas and only storing a few locations.
