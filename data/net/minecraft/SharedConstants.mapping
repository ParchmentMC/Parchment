CLASS net/minecraft/SharedConstants
	COMMENT Shared global constants.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p><strong>Note:</strong> The majority of the fields within this class are {@code public static final} with constant expressions (constants), and are inlined by the Java compiler at all places which reference these constant fields. Therefore, changing the value of these constant fields will have no effect on already compiled code.</p>
	COMMENT
	COMMENT <p>In addition, it is presumed that a large portion of these constant fields (such as those prefixed with {@code DEBUG_} are used as 'flags', for manually toggling code meant for use by Mojang developers in debugging. Therefore, optimizing compilers (which include the Java compiler) may omit the code hidden behind disabled flags, and will result in these flags having no apparent use in the code (when in reality, the optimizing compiler has removed the code which uses them).</p>

	FIELD DATA_PACK_FORMAT I
		COMMENT The format of the data packs used by this game version. Data packs contain server-side data such as recipes, loot tables, and tags.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @see com.mojang.bridge.game.GameVersion#getPackVersion(com.mojang.bridge.game.PackType)
		COMMENT @deprecated Use {@link #getCurrentVersion()}, {@link com.mojang.bridge.game.GameVersion#com.mojang.bridge.game.GameVersion#getPackVersion(com.mojang.bridge.game.PackType)}, and com.mojang.bridge.game.PackType#DATA instead.
	FIELD DATA_VERSION_TAG Ljava/lang/String;
		COMMENT The key for the NBT tag which contains the data version of some data, for use in datafixing.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>For various objects, their stored data in a {@link net.minecraft.nbt.CompoundTag} will usually contain a {@link net.minecraft.nbt.IntTag} indexed with this key, which stores the data version when the data for that object was written out. This is used by the datafixer system to determine which fixers needs to be applied to the data.</p>

		COMMENT @see com.mojang.bridge.game.GameVersion#getWorldVersion()
	FIELD DEFAULT_MINECRAFT_PORT I
		COMMENT The default port used by Minecraft for communication between servers and clients.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>This is not a registered port at the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, and therefore may conflict with existing applications. Minecraft servers may be hosted at other ports, in which case the clients must supply the correct port when connecting to the server.</p>

	FIELD ILLEGAL_FILE_CHARACTERS [C
		COMMENT The characters which may not form part of a file's name. Used in various file processing methods to replace these illegal characters with valid characters, such as the underscore "{@code _}".
		COMMENT

		COMMENT The maximum length of a command that can be typed in a command block by a player.
	FIELD RELEASE_NETWORK_PROTOCOL_VERSION I
		COMMENT The numeric format number for the networking protocol used by the release target of this game version.

		COMMENT <p>This protocol version is used when this game version is a release version, not a {@linkplain #SNAPSHOT snapshots}. For snapshots, see {@link #SNAPSHOT_NETWORK_PROTOCOL_VERSION}.</p>
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @see #getProtocolVersion()
		COMMENT @deprecated Use {@link #getProtocolVersion()} instead.
	FIELD RELEASE_TARGET Ljava/lang/String;
		COMMENT The human readable version target for this game version.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @see com.mojang.bridge.game.GameVersion#getReleaseTarget()
		COMMENT @deprecated Use {@link #getCurrentVersion()} and {@link com.mojang.bridge.game.GameVersion#getReleaseTarget()} instead.
	FIELD RESOURCE_PACK_FORMAT I
		COMMENT The format of the resource packs used by this game version. Resource packs contain client-side assets, such as translation files, models, and textures.

		COMMENT
		COMMENT @see com.mojang.bridge.game.GameVersion#isStable()
		COMMENT @deprecated Use {@link #getCurrentVersion()} and {@link com.mojang.bridge.game.GameVersion#isStable()} instead.
	FIELD SNAPSHOT_NETWORK_PROTOCOL_VERSION I
		COMMENT The numeric format number for the networking protocol used by the snapshot of this game version.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>This protocol version is used when this game version is a {@linkplain #SNAPSHOT snapshot version}. For releases, see {@link #RELEASE_NETWORK_PROTOCOL_VERSION}.</p>
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>The actual networking protocol version used in snapshot versions is the combination (bitwise OR) of this number and the bit at the position marked by {@link #SNAPSHOT_PROTOCOL_BIT}.</p>
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @see #getProtocolVersion()
		COMMENT @deprecated Use {@link #getProtocolVersion()} instead.

		COMMENT
		COMMENT @see #SNAPSHOT_NETWORK_PROTOCOL_VERSION
	FIELD TICKS_PER_GAME_DAY I
		COMMENT The amount of game ticks within a game day. A game day is defined as 20 real-life minutes, so this is equal to {@code TICKS_PER_MINUTE * 20}. This falls under the same guarantees and restrictions as {@link #TICKS_PER_SECOND}.
	FIELD TICKS_PER_MINUTE I
		COMMENT The amount of game ticks within a real-life minute. This is equal to {@code TICKS_PER_SECOND * 60}, and falls under the same guarantees and restrictions as {@link #TICKS_PER_SECOND}.

	FIELD TICKS_PER_SECOND I
		COMMENT The amount of game ticks within a real-life second.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>This is not guaranteed by a running server to be an accurate measurement of real-life seconds. Heavy load on the server may cause the actual tick-to-second ratio to go below this defined ratio.</p>
	FIELD VERSION_STRING Ljava/lang/String;
		COMMENT The human readable name of this game version.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @see com.mojang.bridge.game.GameVersion#getName()

	FIELD WORLD_VERSION I
		COMMENT The numeric format number for worlds used by this game version.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @see com.mojang.bridge.game.GameVersion#getWorldVersion()

		COMMENT Filters the string, keeping only characters for which {@link #isAllowedCharacter(char)} returns {@code true}.
