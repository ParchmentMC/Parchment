	METHOD getFile (Ljava/io/File;)Ljava/io/File;
		COMMENT Creates a unique PNG file in the given directory named by a timestamp.  Handles cases where the timestamp alone is not enough to create a uniquely named file, though it still might suffer from an unlikely race condition where the filename was unique when this method was called, but another process or thread created a file at the same path immediately after this method returned.
