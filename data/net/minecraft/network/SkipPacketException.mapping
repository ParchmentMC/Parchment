CLASS net/minecraft/network/SkipPacketException
	COMMENT Used to signify that a packet encoding error is not fatal. If a packet fails to encode, but {@link net.minecraft.network.protocol.Packet#isSkippable} returns true, then this exception is thrown instead and {@link Connection} will log a message instead of closing the connection.
