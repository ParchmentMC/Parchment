CLASS net/minecraft/network/ConnectionProtocol
	COMMENT Describes the set of packets a connection understands at a given point.
	COMMENT A connection always starts out in state {@link #HANDSHAKING}. In this state the client sends its desired protocol using
	COMMENT {@link ClientIntentionPacket}. The server then either accepts the connection and switches to the desired protocol or it disconnects the client (for example in case of an outdated client).
	COMMENT
	COMMENT Each protocol has a {@link PacketListener} implementation tied to it for server and client respectively.
	COMMENT
	COMMENT Every packet must correspond to exactly one protocol.
	FIELD HANDSHAKING Lnet/minecraft/network/ConnectionProtocol;
		COMMENT The handshake protocol. This is the initial protocol, in which the client tells the server its intention (i.e. which protocol it wants to use).
	FIELD LOGIN Lnet/minecraft/network/ConnectionProtocol;
		COMMENT The login protocol. This is the first protocol the client switches to to join a server. It handles authentication with the mojang servers. After it is complete, the connection is switched to the PLAY protocol.
	FIELD PLAY Lnet/minecraft/network/ConnectionProtocol;
		COMMENT The play protocol. This is the main protocol that is used while "in game" and most normal packets reside in here.
	FIELD STATUS Lnet/minecraft/network/ConnectionProtocol;
		COMMENT The status protocol. This protocol is used when a client pings a server while on the multiplayer screen.
